# Alec D’Alelio

👋 Hi, I’m Alec — a forward-deployed engineer, automation architect, and creative technologist based in NYC.  

I design and build **AI-native tools** and **agentic workflows** that help people move faster, think clearer, and create more freely. My work spans from hands-on engineering to GTM enablement — always focused on turning ideas into production-ready systems.
